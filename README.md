# SortingAnalysis
This program generates randoms in sets of powers of 10s up to 100,000. Each set of randomly generated numbers is sorted using a merge sort algorithm and an insertion sort algorithm. We want to analyze the time completions for each algorithm. <br />

## Results

Merge Sort is faster than Insertion Sort by more than 1,000 seconds. This can be explained by the difference in time complexity between the two algorithms. <br />
Merge Sort has an average time complexity of O(n*log(n)). <br />
Insertion Sort has an average time complexity of (n^2). <br />
